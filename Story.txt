Once upon a time 
There was four girls that all came from different places of the world.
Japan, East Africa, Russia, and Mexico.
They attended the same school in Seattle, Washington. 
They all had different kinds of super powers but were unaware 
When they came to the realization they had super powers
They were all in the met up in the bathroom at the same time at the same bathroom
Which is so odd because there was over 8 different bathrooms in the school
Them meeting at the same time was a sign, a sign they was not ready to see
A few weeks later they met at the same bathroom at the same hour,
it was a big coincidence that may occur once but never twice, 
They started talking about random stuff until the four girls where called.
An enemy appeared who hated school and should be stopped before he collapsed school,
it was time for the girls to show up what are their powers
and how invincibles they are if they're work togheter.
