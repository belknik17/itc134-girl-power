Once upon a time 
There was four girls that all came from different places of the world.
Japan, East Africa, Russia, and Mexico.
They attended the same school in Seattle, Washington. 
They all had different kinds of super powers but were unaware 
When they came to the realization they had super powers
They were all in the met up in the bathroom at the same time at the same bathroom
Which is so odd because there was over 8 different bathrooms in the school
Them meeting at the same time was a sign, a sign they was not ready to see
