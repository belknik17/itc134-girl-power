Once upon a time 
There were four girls that all came from different places of the world.
Japan, East Africa, Russia, and Mexico.
They attended the same school in Seattle, Washington. 
They all had different kinds of super powers but were unaware 
When they came to the realization they had super powers
They have all met up at the same time at the same bathroom
Which was odd because there are over 8 different bathrooms in the school
Them meeting at the same time was a sign, a sign they were not ready to see
A few weeks later, they met at the same bathroom at the same hour again.
It was a big coincidence that may occur once but never twice. 
They started talking about random stuff until the four girls where called.
An enemy appeared who hated the school and should be stopped before he had collapsed the school.
It was time for the girls to show what are their powers
and how invincibles they are if they work togheter.
